"""The service configures the fleet's logging formatter, in the process that actually ships.

This exists because the deployed service did not. Read live against the reference deployment
on 2026-09-15: of roughly 60 `severity>=ERROR` entries on `cloud_run_revision` in thirty days,
every one came from the platform's own request log or from raw stderr. Python tracebacks
arrived as multi-line `textPayload` fragments split across several entries, with no `severity`
from the application, no logger name and no trace field. `configure_logging` was called in 75
files across the workspace and in none of the seven deployed stacks.

What that cost is specific rather than cosmetic. Cloud Logging reads `severity` from the
payload, so an application error was indistinguishable from an info line and could not drive a
log-based metric. `logging.googleapis.com/trace` is what puts a log line inside the request it
came from. And a traceback split across N entries has no single entry carrying the exception,
which is what Error Reporting groups on.

The assertions are about the SHIPPED shape rather than about the kit, which has its own tests.
