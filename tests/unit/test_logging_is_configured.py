"""The service configures the fleet's logging formatter, in the process that actually ships.

This exists because the deployed service did not. Read live against the reference deployment
on 2026-09-15: of roughly 60 `severity>=ERROR` entries on `cloud_run_revision` in thirty days,
every one came from the platform's own request log or from raw stderr. Python tracebacks
arrived as multi-line `textPayload` fragments split across several entries, with no `severity`
from the application, no logger name and no trace field. `configure_logging` was called in 75
files across the workspace and in none of the seven deployed stacks.

What that cost is specific rather than cosmetic. Cloud Logging reads `severity` from the
payload, so an application error was indistinguishable from an info line and could not drive a
log-based metric. `logging.googleapis.com/trace` is what puts a log line inside the request it
came from. And a traceback split across N entries has no single entry carrying the exception,
which is what Error Reporting groups on.

**The import assertions run in a SUBPROCESS, and that is the point rather than a workaround.**
What ships is a fresh interpreter importing the served module under a profile, which is
exactly what a subprocess is. Doing it in-process was tried first and was wrong twice over: it
left a differently-configured module in `sys.modules` for every later test in the session, and
importing under `gcp` installed that profile's middleware, so unrelated suites started seeing
an HSTS header they assert is absent under `local`. Both were caught by CI rather than
reasoned about.
