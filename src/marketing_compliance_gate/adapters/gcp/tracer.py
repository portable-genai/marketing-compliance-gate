"""Managed ObservabilityTracerPort: OpenTelemetry, built by the commons.

This adapter is deliberately thin. All the OpenTelemetry work lives in
``hex_service_kit.tracing`` (the ``otel`` extra), so the exporter choice, the Cloud Run
authentication the agent-observability collector requires, and the rule that a tracing fault never
becomes a request fault are implemented once for the whole fleet rather than per repo. It replaced
a hand-written tracer that exported straight to Cloud Trace, around the collector's redaction.

Spans go OTLP to the agent-observability collector named by ``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT``,
which redacts GenAI content before anything reaches a Google sink. There is no direct Cloud Trace
path: the commons refuses to build a tracer when that variable is unset or empty, so a ``gcp``
deployment without a collector fails loudly on its first span instead of exporting around the
redaction (decision D1 of the guardrail/registry/observability plan). journey-portal injects the
endpoint into every embedded API it deploys.

Message content is never put on a span here or by the commons: spans carry the structural
attributes the caller passes, and token usage as counts.

The commons import is lazy for the usual reason: the local and on-prem profiles import this
package with no cloud SDK installed, and ``hex_service_kit.tracing`` itself imports clean without
OpenTelemetry, but the extra may simply not be present.
